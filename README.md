Hi I'm Rob, owner @studio1902. I design and code websites for clients using the following stack:

* Sketch
* Visual Studio Code
* Statamic and Antlers
* TailwindCSS
* AlpineJS

If you want to find out how I build my websites, check out my [Statamic Starter Kit Peak](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak).
