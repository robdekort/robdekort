## Hello, I'm Rob

I'm the owner @studio1902 and have over 15 years experience in design and development. Statamic is the preferred choice for client work as it enables me to give my customers the best editing experience imaginable.

Wether I built an existing design or a create a custom one fitting your brand, my websites will always look good, perform, rank and are accessible: on any device.

I design and code websites for clients using the following stack:

* Sketch
* Visual Studio Code
* Statamic and Antlers
* TailwindCSS
* AlpineJS

I'm the developer behind [Statamic Peak](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak): a popular Starter Kit for developers. You can [read about it on Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com/statamic-peak).
